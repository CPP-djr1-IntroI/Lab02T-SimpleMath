## Intro to C++ Lab 02

Simple Math

**Date assigned:** 

**Program due:**

**Points:** 

**This is an individual assignment.**

**Goals:**

1.  Work with Visual Studio and Git

2.  Get input from the user, perform simple mathematical calculations and output results


Here is exactly what your program is to output (asterisks and all), and
user input is in **bold**:

<pre>
*******************
Number Cruncher 1.0
*******************

Please enter an integer: <b>9</b>
Please enter an integer: <b>100</b>

Sum: 9 + 100 = 109
Difference: 9 â€“ 100 = -91
</pre>

**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Lab02 Link on The C++ Tutorials in the section Data Input to accept this
        assignment as we've done for Lab01. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to the above assignment specification. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub no later than the
        date and time specified above for your specific section. I will
        only grade your solution from the proper location on GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that C++ is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic pdf (punetidLab02.pdf) of your program is to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
